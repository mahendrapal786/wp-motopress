                  <h3>Goa Beach Huts </h3>
                  <p>Goa beach huts are a popular alternative to the touristy hotels and resorts in tropical Goa. Most of these huts are found in south Goa, particularly Agonda, Palolem, Patnem beaches which are a part of the Canacona region that adjoins Karnataka. These beach huts or cottages offer inexpensive stay to visitors who want to stay long time in Goa. These huts are typically booked for longer periods ranging from one week to three months. </p>
                  <p>Om Sai beach huts are all about location. A hotel 3 kms away from the beach will not give you the feeling of being in Goa. Our cottages are right there on the beach - the famous Agonda beach at a stone throwaway distance from the waters. Our eco-friendly huts are reconstructed for the season, which runs from November to May and pulled down every year after May once the rain gods unleash their fury. </p>
